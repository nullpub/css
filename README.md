# Introduction

This project exists because I found other atomic/functional css libraries to be lacking. The goals of this project are as follows:

- Provide themeable and highly reusable classes for layout and themes.
- Provide a sensible api that follows a simple pattern.
- Not just mobile first, but all viewports should look good if best practices are followed. This means the library must breakpoint well and be highly customizable for multiple typographies and designes.
